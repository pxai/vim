### Substitution

- :%s/var/foo/gi

% means **all lines**
[range] can be 1,10
Changing separators:

## Text Objects
Text or code has certain limits like paragraphs and special symbols.
In a text file, common text objects are:
- w: word
- s: sentence
- p: paragraph
- {}: brackets
- []: square brackets
- (): parenthesis
- <>: tags/angular brackets
- ": limits of a string

We can use these objects with commands in order to insert, append, delete text, appplying
this options:
- a: all
- i: inner

<command> + [a|i] + <text-object>
Where commans can be: d, c, r
For example:
- diw: delete a word
- dap: delete all paragraph
- dis: delete inner sentence.
- da]: delete all with brackets
- di]: delete what's inside the brackets
- ci]: change what's inside the brackets
- dat: delete a tag
- dit: delete what's inside the tag

## Macros
Macros are use to recording and creating complex commands that can be invoked with a @
- To start recording a macro use q + letter.
- This will store the macro in @letter.
- Then finish recording typing q again
- To execute just type: @letter

It's a good option to us 0 to beginm then j to finish in the next line.
We can apply a macro to different lines:
number@macro
number,number@macro

We can also store a macro in .vimrc:

let @c='0i# ^[j'

That macro will start the line with a # symbol.
Notice that it's just a sequence of vim commands. For ESC you must use ^[

## Visual Mode
- v: enter visual mode
- V: visual mode in the line
- Ctrl-v: visual mode by blocks

Once you enter visual model, you can select blocks of text mobing with hjkl. 
After that, you can apply c,d,r,c,I,A,J,u,U, <,> commands

### Visual mode + text selections

For example, to apply **indentation** in code files:
- gv>

Some useful settings:
:set shiftwidth=8
:set tabstop=8 (width of tab)
:set noexpandtab  (to use spaces instead of tabs)

:'<,'> s/what/new

Selected area

:'<,'> center [80]
:'<,'> center 40

Example. Add comment to some lines:

Ctrl-v + select with j + i # + ESC
